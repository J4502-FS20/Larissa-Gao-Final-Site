  <h1>Current treatment for mental illnesses</h1>
  <p> Most treatment methods for mental health disorders can be categorized as "somatic treatments and psychotherapeutic treatments," according to <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/mental-health-disorders/overview-of-mental-health-care/treatment-of-mental-illness">Merck Manual Consumer Version</a>. There are three kinds of therapies that psychiatrists normally use to treat patients.</p>
  <div id="h3">
    <p>1. Medication therapy</p>
  </div>
  <p>Medications can largely improve the situations of mentally ill, even though they won't cure thoes illnesses, according to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374974#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20most%20commonly%20used%20classes%20of,3%20Mood-stabilizing%20medications.%20...%204%20Antipsychotic%20medications.%20">the Mayo Clinic</a>. Different drugs can treat specific symptoms. For example, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/escitalopram.html">Escitalopram</a> can treat people with depression or anxiety.</p>
  <div id="h4">
     <p>2. Electroconvulsive therapy</p>
  </div>
  <p>Sounds scary, right? In the past, "patients regularly suffered from broken bones and related induries during the therapy," according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/electroconvulsive-therapy">the Healthline</a>. But you shouldn't feel scared because this therapy is a pretty safe method now that is used to cure people with clinical depression or people who don't "respond to medication or talk therapy." Two authentic organizations, the American Medical Association and the National Institutes of Mental Health, support this treatment.</p>
  <div id="h5">
     <p>3. Psychotherapy</p>
  </div>
  <p>It is also known as the talk therapy. According to the definition on <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml">the National Institute of Mental Health</a>, "psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts and behaviors." In other words, psychologists use techniques to talk with patients to help them understand their own illnesses. A person without a diagnosed mental disorder can use this treatment to relieve their stresses. Also, psychologists are not allowed to reveal any record to others without patients' permission.</p>

  <h2>Stress Relief</h2>
  <p>For people who don't have mental disorders, they need to learn how to relax to prevent themselves from having mental disorders. Here are some tips from one of my friends, who had mental health disorders. She said the following tips are helpful and she hopes her experience can help more people in similar situations.</p>
  <div id="h6">
     <p>1. Watch films â€” comedies or tragedies </p>
  </div>
  <p>Comedies can help you laugh, while laughing can make you feel better and happier. Tragedies can make you cry because crying can help you enhance the mood. This is because tears contain <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542012412701842">stress hormones and other chemicals</a>. However, if you found yourself crying without any reason, you really need to seek professional help because that is one symption of some mental health disorders.</p>
  <div id="h7">
     <p>2. Exercise </p>
  </div>
  <p>Physical exercises can help release mental stress. Even five-minute exercise can help you maintain energy. But please in mind that when you feel sick, such as headache, do not exercise unless you know why you feel sick. This is because exercising sometimes can make some physical illnesses worse. Physical health could have a huge impact on your mental wellness. Meanwhile, keeping healthy is always the most important thing for all of the people.</p>
  <div id="h8">
     <p>3. Go back to the nature</p>
  </div>
  <p>Going outside may be the quickest way to relieve stress. You can forget everything you are busy with when you are far away from your home and your workplace. However, due to the pandemic, please wear your masks on when you go outside to protect yourself. </p>
