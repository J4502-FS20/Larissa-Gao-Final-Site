  <h1>The History of Mental Illnesses</h1>
  <h2>By Larissa Gao</h2>
  <p>Mental illnesses are <a href="https://www.healthyplace.com/other-info/mental-illness-overview/mental-illness-definition-what-is-mental-illness">diseases of the brain</a>. The mental illness history goes back as far as the first written records. In ancient times, different countries had different ways to treat people. For example, in ancient China, mental disorders were treated under traditional Chinese medicine by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870484/ ">using herbs, acupuncture or “emotional therapy.”</a> However, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&q=Inana&hl=en ">in Mesopotamia</a>, mental illnesses were believed to be caused by gods and people with mental disorders were regarded as “hands” of gods because hands symbolized control over a person. A great leap in Greek took place In 400 B.C. when Greek physician Hippocrates, began to treat mental illnesses as physiological illnesses, according to HealthyPlace.</p>

  <p>In Europe, people with mental illnesses can be free in some places if they didn’t have any sign to show they were dangerous. However, in other places, people with mental illnesses were treated poorly and said to be witches, according to HealthyPlace. </p>
  <p>In the 1600s, Europeans began to treat people with mental disorders inhumanly. They normally would chain them to walls or keep them in dungeons. The mentally ill often lived with the disabled, vagrants and criminals.</p>

  <p>In 1700s, many people were concerned about treating people with mental disorders. In some places, the shackling of the mental ill was forbidden. However, mistreatment still existed.</p>
  <h2>History in 1800s</h2>
  <p>In the U.S., people with mental disorders were regarded as criminals. They were mistreated as people in some places in Europe. At that time, Dorothea Dix, a U.S. reformer, pushed to establish hospitals for those people. Unfortunately, the human treatment didn’t cure them, which led to an emphasis on custodial care, according to HealthyPlace.</p>
  <p>At the end of 1880s, Emil Kraepelin, a German psychiatrist, started to study mental illnesses in a scientific way.</p>
  <h2>History after 20th Century</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-clinical-psychiatry-the-origin-and-history-of-psychiatric-disorders/oclc/32823926 ">Kareapelin’s classification gained popularity</a>, which separated mood disorders from schizophrenia, which is a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior. </p>
  <p>In the U.S., a “mental hygiene” movement took place, which aimed to prevent the disease of insanity through public health methods and clinics, according to HealthyPlace. “Mental health” became more popular. In 1946, Harry Truman signed the National Mental Health Act calling for conducting research into the mind. Then, the National Institute of Mental Health was formed in 1949 as a result of the law.</p>
  <p>In the mid-1950s, the number of hospitalized people with mental disorders peaked at around 560,000 in the U.S., which made many people expelled from those institutions. However, many people become homeless after that due to lack of housing and follow-up care. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile, lobotomy was invested by Portuguese neurologist António Egas Moniz. It is a form of psychosurgery that involves incision into prefrontal lobe of the brain. Many people with mental illness accepted the surgery during that time, <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/lobotomy2.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20about%2050%2C000%20patients%20were,performed%20lobotomies%2C%20believed%20that%20they%20could%20relieve%20suffering.">including the sister of John F. Kennedy, Rosemary Kennedy</a>.</p>

  <p>Although now this treatment is regarded as a way that is contrary to principles of humanity, it was extremely popular among doctors in the 1950s. Because the behaviors of people will change a lot after the surgery, some doctors called lobotomy as "soul surgery." Therefore, they really liked to do the surgery because they felt like they made a difference on others' souls. However, as time goes by, psychologists found the treatment was not scientific. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-166">In 1950</a>, Soviet Union banned the procesure. Doctors in Soviet Union said "through lobotomy, an insane person is changed into an idiot." By 1970s, many countries had banned the procesure.</p>
  <h2>Modern Day</h2>
  <p>Nowadays, ways to treat the mental ill tend to be more scientific. People tend to know more about mental health illnesses and the factors that lead to mental health illnesses. More and more people in the world can be sympathetic about people with mental disorders. They will learn to relax to prevent getting mental illnesses. Even though in some places, people still feel the mentally ill are dangerous, but the law will help protect people with mental illnesses. </p>
